/**
 * Resources
 *
 * Unsurprisingly, most of your day-to-day work with a Dropwizard application will be in the resource classes, which
 * model the resources exposed in your RESTful API. Dropwizard uses Jersey for this, so most of this section is just
 * re-hashing or collecting various bits of Jersey documentation.
 *
 * Jersey is a framework for mapping various aspects of incoming HTTP requests to POJOs and then mapping various
 * aspects of POJOs to outgoing HTTP responses.
