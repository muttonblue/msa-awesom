/**
 * Commands
 *
 * Commands are basic actions which Dropwizard runs based on the arguments provided on the command line.
 * The built-in server command, for example, spins up an HTTP server and runs your application.
 * Each Command subclass has a name and a set of command line options which
 * Dropwizard will use to parse the given command line arguments.
